<h1>A .htaccess reference (tips &amp; tricks)</h1>

<p class="date">2010-11-23</p>

<p>Adding or modifying a <em>.htaccess</em> file on an Apache web server to override some configurations or create redirects is extremely useful, but is something I rarely do. Usually a few times during a new web project, which makes it somewhat hard to remember the proper commands and syntax to make it behave the way you want.</p>

<p>Anyway, I came across this really handy article with more or less a complete reference of the most common .htaccess tasks. It's divided into two parts and you can read it here: <a href="http://corz.org/serv/tricks/htaccess.php" target="_blank">http://corz.org/serv/tricks/htaccess.php</a></p>
