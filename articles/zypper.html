  <h1>OpenSuse 12.2's Package Manager</h1>
  
  <p class="date">2013-01-19</p>
  
  <p>I'm posting this mini-entry as it took so much effort to find the name of OpenSuse's package manager, especially considering that it wasn't my computer. OpenSuse 12's package manager is called <strong>zypper</strong>! Example of usage:</p>
  
  <pre><code class="bash"># zypper install emacs</code></pre>
